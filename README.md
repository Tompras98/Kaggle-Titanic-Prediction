# Kaggle-Titanic-Prediction

Hi everyone, this is my try in the competition of Titanic Survival Prediction in Kaggle.com.
Check it out: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/overview

The data has been split into two groups:
training set (train.csv)
test set (test.csv)

 For the training set,  the outcome is provided (also known as the “ground truth”) for each passenger.
 The test set is used to see how well my model performs on unseen data. For the test set, is not provided the ground truth for each passenger.

The accuracy score of this try is 76% using the HistogramGradientBoosting classifier which had the best accuracy among other machine learnings algorithms in order to predict the survival rate for each passenger of Titanic.

More information about the analysis of the dataset and the proccess of the model coming soon.

Until then you can see the comments in the notebook uploaded.
